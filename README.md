## Takeaways from building this
As I'm building this, I've definitely increased my understanding of how neovim itself works. However, a lot of what I've needed to figure out seems pretty plugin-specific, meaning that if one of the plugins I use were to disappear I wouldn't immediately know how to get the functionality back some other way.

After writing that, I've gained a lot more comfort with figuring neovim stuff out. The help is incredibly useful, and I'm confident I can just figure all of these things out now. I'm way less worried that I would lose functionality if one of my plugins were to disappear.
